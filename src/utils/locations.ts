export const SPECIAL_LOCATIONS = [...DARK_SITES, ...LARGE_CITIES];

export const HIGH_LATITUDE_MESSAGE = `<h2>Galactic Core Below the Horizon</h2><p>The center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, lies in the constellation Sagittarius. In the sky, it has a fixed position just like a bright star, with a “declination” of about <strong>29 degrees south</strong>. Declination is a coordinate similar to latitude on Earth, but it’s used for the celestial sphere. Because the Galactic Center is so far south in the sky, your location on Earth determines whether you can see it at all.</p>

<p>If you live <strong>north of about 61° N</strong> — for example in northern Alaska, parts of Canada, or far northern Scandinavia — the Galactic Center never rises above the horizon, so it’s permanently hidden from view. The farther south you go, the higher it climbs in the sky at its peak each night. Around <strong>30° N</strong> (southern United States, North Africa, southern China) it reaches about 60° above the horizon. Near the <strong>29° S</strong> line (central Chile, South Africa, southern Australia), it passes directly overhead. In the far south, below <strong>61° S</strong> (deep Antarctica), the Galactic Center never sets and is visible all year round.</p>

<p>This is why astrophotographers often travel to southern latitudes — from there, the Milky Way’s core appears higher in the sky, stays visible longer, and can be seen in darker parts of the night.</p>

`;

export const LARGE_CITY_MESSAGE = `<h2>City Lights vs Star Light</h2><p>Even if the Galactic Center is high in the sky where you live, you might not be able to see the Milky Way at all if you are in or near a large city. This is because of <strong>light pollution</strong> — the glow from streetlights, buildings, billboards, and cars that scatters in the atmosphere and drowns out faint objects in the night sky. The Milky Way is made up of billions of stars, but most of them are faint. Under heavy light pollution, only the brightest stars remain visible, and the Milky Way’s soft, cloudlike glow disappears completely.</p>

<p>To see it clearly, you need to be under <strong>dark skies</strong> — far from cities, towns, and major roads. Astronomers often use the <strong>Bortle scale</strong> to measure sky darkness. In the brightest city skies (Bortle 9), you might see only a dozen stars. In very dark rural areas (Bortle 1–2), thousands of stars are visible, and the Milky Way shines brightly across the sky. If you live in an urban area, plan to travel at least an hour or two away from the city lights, ideally to a place protected from development such as a national park or an official “Dark Sky” preserve.</p>`;

## Instructions

Instructions for Writing Location Descriptions

Each entry should be an HTML string that will render nicely in a web app.
Use the compact location identifier as the key (matching your SPECIAL_LOCATIONS fifth element).

⸻

1. Heading:
	•	Begin with an <h2> containing the official site name (e.g., “Bryce Canyon National Park”).

⸻

2. Introductory Paragraphs:
	•	Describe the overall darkness and sky quality:
	•	Give the typical Bortle scale rating and a qualitative summary (“Bortle 2 skies”, “virtually no light pollution”, etc.).
	•	Analyze light pollution:
	•	Name nearby cities and note where glows appear on the horizon.
	•	Mention if these can be avoided by facing certain directions or by choosing specific areas.
	•	Seasonal & Celestial Highlights:
	•	Milky Way core season: Which months is it visible?
	•	Best time of night or year (e.g., “core at zenith in July”, “best after midnight in spring”).
	•	Other phenomena: Mention notable meteor showers, potential for aurora (if applicable), southern objects (Magellanic Clouds), etc.
	•	Moon phase tips: Recommend new moon or “week after first quarter” for best dark sky photography.
	•	Unique site extras:
	•	Mention any famous astronomy events (star parties, festivals, ranger-led programs).
	•	Any signature experiences or unique challenges (e.g., fog, wildlife, temperature swings).

⸻

3. Stargazing Spots (Ordered List):
	•	Use an <ol> with at least two, up to four, specific named locations in the park for night sky photography.
	•	Each <li> should include:
	•	The location name (bolded).
	•	A phrase about what makes it ideal (“wide open horizons”, “iconic foregrounds”, “reflective water”, etc.).
	•	If possible, tips on what’s visible (e.g., “core aligns with the arch in June”).

⸻

4. Practical Sections (Each as a Subheading and Paragraph):

Use <h3> for subheadings:

Camping
	•	Options inside the park (campgrounds, backcountry, dispersed, or none).
	•	Which are best for dark skies or easy night access?
	•	Mention reservations, seasonality, or special rules if relevant.

Lodging
	•	Notable hotels, lodges, or towns nearby.
	•	Which ones are closest or offer the least light pollution?

Access
	•	Best time(s) of year, seasonal closures, weather challenges.
	•	Park hours, road access, need for permits, or other tips for night shooters.

Official Links
	•	Always close with:

<p><a href="...">Official [Site Name] Website</a></p>

(or the most authoritative astronomy link if it’s a dark sky park)

⸻

Style/Tone Guidelines
	•	Friendly, knowledgeable, and encouraging.
	•	Write to an audience that includes both serious astrophotographers and newcomers.
	•	Avoid long, dense paragraphs; break up ideas for clarity.
	•	Specific, actionable info is better than generic prose (“shoot facing east from X trail for the darkest skies”).
	•	Add small “insider tips” where possible (“arrive early for astronomy events,” “bring bug spray in May”).
	•	Emphasize what makes the location special for stargazers.

⸻

  yellowstone: `
    <h2>Yellowstone National Park</h2>
    <p>Yellowstone is a stargazer’s paradise, with vast swaths of Bortle 1–2 skies that rank among the darkest in the continental U.S. The park’s remote high plateaus, geothermal basins, and mirror-like lakes create otherworldly foregrounds for Milky Way photography.</p>
    <p>Light pollution is almost nonexistent in the park’s central and southern reaches, but faint glows can be seen toward Gardiner, West Yellowstone, and Cody on the horizons. Wildlife such as bison, elk, and wolves roam freely, making night travel here exhilarating but requiring caution.</p>
    <p>The Milky Way core is best viewed here from late May to early September, with the Galactic Center reaching its highest point in the sky around midnight in July. Autumn brings crystal-clear air, fewer visitors, and more hours of true darkness.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Lamar Valley</strong> – Sweeping meadows with unobstructed horizons and almost zero light pollution; ideal for wide-field Milky Way arcs.</li>
      <li><strong>Hayden Valley</strong> – Misty rivers at dawn provide ethereal foregrounds for night-to-day timelapses.</li>
      <li><strong>West Thumb on Yellowstone Lake</strong> – Combines geothermal features, water reflections, and pristine skies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Bridge Bay Campground offers lakeside access to dark skies, while Slough Creek is perfect for remote solitude. Backcountry camping permits are required for more isolated spots.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Old Faithful Snow Lodge is open in winter and provides rare cold-season astrophotography opportunities. Lake Yellowstone Hotel offers comfort close to prime Milky Way locations.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Most interior roads open late May through early November. Snow and wildlife may restrict night driving in shoulder seasons.</p>

  yosemite: `
    <h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
    <p>Yosemite pairs some of the world’s most iconic landscapes with surprisingly dark skies, especially in its high country. From the Bortle 2 skies of Tuolumne Meadows to the Bortle 4 glow of Yosemite Valley, the contrast in conditions is as dramatic as its granite walls.</p>
    <p>Light domes from Fresno, Madera, and Modesto subtly affect southern and western horizons, but high-elevation viewpoints easily rise above them. Summer offers warm, dry nights for Milky Way shooting, while winter brings snowy foregrounds for dramatic contrasts.</p>
    <p>The park hosts popular astronomy programs at <strong>Glacier Point</strong> on select summer weekends, featuring powerful telescopes and ranger-led talks—perfect for pairing stargazing with photography.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Glacier Point</strong> – Unbeatable panoramas of Half Dome under the Milky Way; best in July–August when the core sits high above the horizon.</li>
      <li><strong>Olmsted Point</strong> – Smooth granite slabs and sparse pines create minimalist yet striking compositions.</li>
      <li><strong>Tuolumne Meadows</strong> – Alpine meadow expanses with minimal artificial light; excellent for timelapses.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Tuolumne Meadows Campground offers prime high-country access but is only open summer–early fall. Upper Pines is the best valley-floor option but has more light pollution.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>The Ahwahnee Hotel offers comfort and iconic architecture but is in the valley’s brighter zone. For darker skies, White Wolf Lodge and High Sierra Camps are better bases.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Tioga Pass opens late May–July depending on snowpack. Arrive early for Glacier Point events; parking fills quickly on astronomy nights.</p>

  sequoia: `
    <h2>Sequoia National Park</h2>
    <p>Sequoia’s Bortle 2–3 skies come alive above the silhouettes of the largest trees on Earth. High-elevation viewpoints often sit above low-lying haze, offering pristine Milky Way visibility.</p>
    <p>Light domes from the Central Valley are visible on the western horizon, but disappear entirely when shooting east or overhead. Clear nights in summer and early fall are best; winter offers low humidity but restricted road access.</p>
    <p>The combination of ancient giant sequoias and the galactic core in a single frame is unique to this park, especially in the Giant Forest region.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Moro Rock</strong> – 360° views and a dramatic granite perch; watch for strong winds.</li>
      <li><strong>Crescent Meadow</strong> – Meadow foregrounds framed by towering trees; low visitor traffic at night.</li>
      <li><strong>Panorama Point</strong> – Elevated perspective with minimal western light dome.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Lodgepole Campground is well-situated for dark sky shooting. Atwood and Dorst Creek offer quieter stays deeper in the forest.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Wuksachi Lodge provides year-round lodging in the heart of the park. Cabins in nearby Kings Canyon expand dark-sky access.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Snow can linger into late May. Many high-country sites are accessible only by winding mountain roads—plan extra travel time for night shoots.</p>

  kingscanyon: `
    <h2>Kings Canyon National Park</h2>
    <p>Kings Canyon is one of California’s least light-polluted mountain parks, with Bortle 2 skies dominating its deep valleys and rugged peaks. Its remote location and fewer visitors compared to Yosemite make it a quiet astrophotography haven.</p>
    <p>Light pollution is negligible except for a faint glow from Fresno to the west, which can be avoided by facing east toward the Sierra crest. Summer nights are warm in the valley but cool quickly at higher elevations.</p>
    <p>The Milky Way core is visible from late May to early September, with August offering the highest, brightest core above the canyon walls.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Panoramic Point</strong> – Expansive views across the canyon; perfect for wide-field astrophotography.</li>
      <li><strong>Cedar Grove</strong> – Towering cliffs frame the Galactic Core dramatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Zumwalt Meadow</strong> – River reflections with forest silhouettes under the Milky Way.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Cedar Grove and Sheep Creek Campgrounds have minimal artificial light and easy access to open views of the night sky.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Grant Grove Cabins offer rustic charm and proximity to high-elevation viewpoints.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>The Cedar Grove area is only open late spring through fall due to snow. Roads are winding—allow extra time for night driving.</p>

  pinnacles: `
    <h2>Pinnacles National Park</h2>
    <p>Pinnacles, known for its jagged rock spires and rare California condors, offers Bortle 3 skies in the east and Bortle 4 in the west. Its proximity to the coast means occasional marine layer fog, which can actually block coastal light domes for clearer stars above.</p>
    <p>Light domes from Salinas and Hollister affect the northern and western horizons but are easily avoided by shooting east toward the mountains.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>High Peaks Trail</strong> – Sweeping views above the rock formations, ideal for galactic arcs.</li>
      <li><strong>Bear Gulch Reservoir</strong> – Calm water reflections and unique rock silhouettes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Pinnacles Campground on the east side has the darkest skies and direct hiking access to prime locations.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>No lodges inside the park; nearest accommodations are in Soledad and Hollister.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>East entrance is best for night access; the west entrance closes at sunset.</p>

  redwood: `
    <h2>Redwood National and State Parks</h2>
    <p>The towering coastal redwoods provide a surreal foreground for astrophotography. While the coastal fog can be a challenge, clear inland areas within the park reach Bortle 2–3 skies.</p>
    <p>Light domes from Crescent City and Eureka are minor but noticeable to the west; inland shooting toward the forest or eastward hills provides darker skies.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prairie Creek Redwoods</strong> – Dense groves for Milky Way peeking through the canopy.</li>
      <li><strong>Bald Hills</strong> – Above the fog line, with sweeping inland views.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Gold Bluffs Beach Campground offers unique oceanfront stargazing opportunities, weather permitting.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Nearby towns like Klamath and Orick have small inns; camping provides the best night sky access.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Fog is common in summer; best astrophotography conditions occur after inland heat pushes fog offshore.</p>

  channelislands: `
    <h2>Channel Islands National Park</h2>
    <p>Offshore isolation gives the Channel Islands some of the darkest skies in Southern California (Bortle 2). The lack of large-scale lighting on the islands means pristine Milky Way views—though marine haze can affect clarity.</p>
    <p>Light domes from Los Angeles and Ventura are faint glows low on the northern horizon, largely blocked by island terrain.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Scorpion Anchorage (Santa Cruz Island)</strong> – Beachfront views with minimal obstruction.</li>
      <li><strong>Anacapa Island Lookout</strong> – Open ocean horizon and minimal artificial light.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Scorpion Ranch Campground offers walk-in sites right near dark beaches. All camping is primitive; bring all supplies.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>No lodging on the islands; overnight stays require camping.</p>

    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Reached only by boat or small plane; check ferry schedules and plan around weather.</p>

  glacier: `
    <h2>Glacier National Park</h2>
    <p>Glacier’s Bortle 1–2 skies are legendary, with towering peaks and alpine lakes perfect for Milky Way reflections. High-altitude air offers exceptional clarity, especially in late summer.</p>
    <p>Light domes are almost nonexistent except for faint glows near Kalispell and east-side towns. Ranger-led astronomy programs are held at Logan Pass and Apgar Village during summer.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Logan Pass</strong> – Milky Way rising over jagged peaks; high alpine foregrounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Lake McDonald</strong> – Still water for pristine reflections of the night sky.</li>
      <li><strong>Many Glacier</strong> – Dramatic mountain silhouettes beneath the galactic arc.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Many Glacier Campground provides dark skies with minimal travel after night shoots.</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Historic lodges like Many Glacier Hotel and Lake McDonald Lodge combine comfort with proximity to dark skies.</p>

  greatbasin: `
    <h2>Great Basin National Park</h2>
    <p>Great Basin, a Gold Tier International Dark Sky Park, is renowned for its extraordinarily dark, clear skies—among the darkest in the continental U.S. (Bortle 1–2). The high elevation, remote desert setting, and dry climate combine for incredible celestial clarity. With virtually no urban centers nearby, light pollution is almost non-existent.</p>
    <p>Milky Way core season peaks from late April to early September, with the galaxy arching high overhead by midnight in midsummer. Summer is prime for new moon stargazing and the park’s annual Astronomy Festival. In winter, expect dazzling Orion and crisp star fields, though nighttime temps are frigid. Meteor showers—especially the Perseids and Geminids—are spectacular here.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mather Overlook</strong> – Sweeping, high-elevation views, perfect for panoramic Milky Way shots and astronomy events.</li>
      <li><strong>Stella Lake</strong> – Reflects Wheeler Peak and stars in its still waters; a magical spot for night photography.</li>
      <li><strong>Lehman Caves Area</strong> – Close to ranger-led night sky programs and public telescope viewing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Camping</h3>
    <p>Four main campgrounds (Upper and Lower Lehman Creek, Baker Creek, and Wheeler Peak). Wheeler Peak Campground sits at 10,000 feet for the ultimate sky but can be very cold—even in summer. Summer fills fast during astronomy events; reserve if possible.</p>
    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>No in-park lodging; motels and cabins in tiny Baker, NV. For best darkness, camp in the park or stay at Wheeler Peak Lodge just outside the entrance.</p>
    <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Best access late spring through early fall. Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive closes in winter beyond Upper Lehman. Prepare for mountain weather and big temperature swings.</p>

  flagstaffmonuments: `
    <h2>Flagstaff Area National Monuments</h2>
    <p>Flagstaff, the world's first “International Dark Sky City,” is surrounded by protected monuments—<strong>Wupatki</strong>, <strong>Sunset Crater Volcano</strong>, and <strong>Walnut Canyon</strong>—all certified for their night skies. Bortle 3–4 overall, but at Wupatki you can get true darkness (Bortle 2) with minimal city glow on the horizon. Flagstaff’s strict lighting codes help, but avoid looking southwest toward the city lights.</p>
    <p>Milky Way core is best May–September, rising above the painted desert and ancient pueblos. Watch for meteor showers in August (Perseids) and December (Geminids). Occasional ranger “Explore the Stars” nights are hosted at Wupatki or Sunset Crater—arrive early for a spot!</p>

    <h3>Lodging</h3>
    <p>Many hotels in Flagstaff, just a short drive away. For darkest skies, stay outside the city limits near Sunset Crater.</p>
    <h3>Access</h3>
