- When clicking on "find me", location input field jumps to known location Also
  shown in Location button. Should only be used to show location description.
- Go over each dark site, use the Bortle map to find the darkest Bortle value in
  a 50km radius. Adjust the lat/long to match the darkest Bortle value.
- Explore is showing a bunch of nearby locations that are clustered. If a
  location is within 10km of another, move on.

- Explore may need icons for maps, etc...

- There is a fadein transition on the light pollution map in Explore which is
  more distracting than helpful.

- In Explore, the location button should bring up to location popover.

  - The Find Nearest Dark Site button does not seem useful. The keys for the
    Found Locations Map are redundant. There should be only one, outside the map
    box

- Primary Dark Site -> Recommended Dark Site
